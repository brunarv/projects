			<h2>Who am I?</h2>

			<p>My name is Bruna Ramos Vieira. I am a woman in love for life, family, friends, animals and technology.  Someone that wake up every day and 
				feel happy  for being alive, to have a new opportunity to learn and provide something good for who are around me whether in life or at work. 
				I am someone with sense of ownership and passion for quality.</p><br>	
				
			<p>Travel Lover, that's  me! I am from Brazil and I came to Vancouver almost two years ago. Having the opportunity to live abroad was always a 
				dream for me, however I wanted more than an experience of an exchange, I wanted to 
				do something that could contribute in my career, that's why I decided to enroll in the Applied Software Development (ASD) and Applied 
				Web Development (AWD) programs at BCIT. And so far, it has been a great journey full of challenges!</p><br>			

            <p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information System from Pontifícia Universidade Católica (Campinas/SP - Brazil) and I am an IBQTS Foundation 
				Level certified tester.</p>
