			<h1>A little bit about me</h1>    
		         <h2>Who am I?</h2> 
					<p>My name is <b>Bruna Ramos Vieira</b> and my student number is <b>A00985171</b>. I am from Brazil and I arrived in Vancouver last September. Having the opportunity to live abroad was always a dream for me, however I wanted more than an experience of an exchange, I wanted to do something that could contribute in my career. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information System from Pontif&iacute;cia Universidade Cat&oacute;lica (Campinas/SP - Brazil) and I am an IBQTS Foundation Level certified tester.</p>
						
					<h2>Why am I taking this course?</h2>
					<p>I've started the <b>Computer System program</b> at BCIT in January. It has been a challenging experience, but I'm loving all it. I am taking this course as part of the Computer System program and also because I am interested on Web Development, although I have no pofessional experiences with developing software or programming language, it is a skill that I would like to learn more.</p>
					
					<h2>What do I do?</h2>
					<p>I have been working as a <b>Software Quality Assurance Analyst</b> for 5 years. I have an experience in all the different testing phases in the software lifecycle. My work experience involved all the parts of information systems and software testing: test plan elaboration, test case creation, environment preparation, execution and report creation, defect management, execution management. I have performed in projects for Printers, Notebooks, Tablets, Mobile Phone and SmartWatch device with methodology scrum.</p>
					
					<h2>My current interests</h2>
					<p>My current interests include technology, reading, movie, music, running, stay with friends and family, and travelling.</p>
