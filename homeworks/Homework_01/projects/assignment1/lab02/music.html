	<h2>Shania Twain</h2> 
	<p>I grew up with Shania Twain's music. She is Canadian, as I am living in Canada currently, that's why I decided to describe my passion for this great singer. </p>
	
	<p>One of the best voice, the best performer, and a great person. She's a music legend. I love her voice, her thoughts, the way her dressing and everything about her. She's a great woman! </p>
	
	<p> Two years ago I had the great pleasure to watch her concert for the first time in my live. It was in Las Vegas and definitely was an unforgettable day.</p>
