	<h1 align="center">A Walk to Remember</h1>
	
	<p>If you like memorable movies, you have to watch A Walk to Remember, it is very appealing. That is my favorite movie. This movie is based on the book of the novel by Nicholas Sparks. It is hard to classify this film, but I suppose it is a drama and if you wacth it, you will agree with me. I particularly love everything in this movie. The setting is fantastic, it shows many beautiful places and romantics. But what I really like and admit that became an addict in my life was the soundtrack this movie.  Consists of songs from various bands such as Switchfoot, and songs sung by Mandy Moore that interpreted the Jamie, the main character.
	
	<p>The movie is about a story of transformation, love and faith.  Landon is a young man with no goals and irresponsible that was punished for having made a bad joke with a guy that almost was paraplegic.  As punishment , the school director caused him participate in the school's theater company that was being assembled. During the essay, Landon met Jamie Sullivan. She was pastor's daughter of a small town and soon he began to approach of her. She started to help him to memorize the texts in her house, but with only one condition: that he did not fall in love to her. So the unexpected happened, they fell in love, but Jamie had a secret : she had leukemia two years ago, for this reason she asked he did not fall in love. Landon did not understand why this was happening because they loved each other and everything seemed perfect. The health status of Jamie was worsening. So Landon planned to realize all old dream of Jamie and he got it. One of the her biggest dream was to marry a white dress in the same church that his mother and father married. Although she was on the verge of death, Landon asked Jamie to marry him and they lived happily all summer, until the death of Jamie . After miss his beloved Landon went to study in another city. A few years later he back to his old town totally transformated.</p>

	<p>There are many message in this movie, but I believe that the main message is even that Jamie left this world so early, she witnessed a small miracle, the transformation of Landon , he was an irresponsible teenager with no goals and rude , in a bright and sweet boy . Furthermore this relation left a big message that the love is patient and kind, all protects, all trusts, all hopes, all perseveres and all transform to better.</p>
