			<p><strong>Description:</strong> Three buddies wake up from a bachelor party in Las Vegas, with no memory of the previous night and the bachelor 
				missing. They make their way around the city in order to find their friend before his wedding.</p>
		
			<p><strong>My review:</strong> One of the best comedies I've ever seen. Original, very good story, funny script 
			and very comical. Highlight for the actors where there is a lot of chemistry.</p>

			<p> <strong>Description:</strong> The Green Mile is a 1999 American fantasy crime drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont and 
				adapted from the 1996 Stephen King novel of the same name. <br>

				The film is told in a flashback format and stars Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, and Michael Clarke Duncan 
				as John Coffey, with supporting roles by David Morse, Bonnie Hunt, and James Cromwell. The film also 
				features Dabbs Greer in his final film, as the old Paul Edgecomb. It tells the story of Paul's life 
				as a death row corrections officer during the U.S. Great Depression, and the supernatural events he 
				witnessed.

				The film was nominated for four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor for Michael 
				Clarke Duncan, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Adapted Screenplay.<br>
			</p>

			<p><strong>My review:</strong> The Green Mile stirs our feelings in such a way that it is understandable
			 	that we try to analyze it deeper than many would expect. The film is so magnetic that we hardly notice 
			 	the passing of the hours. And even when the story comes to an end, the film stays with you for much longer. 
			 	In my option, The Green Mile is one of the best films of the 90s.
