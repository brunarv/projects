			<p><strong>Description:</strong> Breaking Bad is an American crime drama television series created and 
			produced by Vince Gilligan. The show originally aired on the AMC network for five seasons, from January 20, 
			2008, to September 29, 2013. It tells the story of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a struggling high school 
			chemistry teacher diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. Together with his former student Jesse Pinkman 
			(Aaron Paul), White turns to a life of crime, producing and selling crystallized methamphetamine to secure
			 his family's financial future before he dies, while navigating the dangers of the criminal world. 
			 The title is from a Southern colloquialism meaning to "raise hell". Breaking Bad is set and was 
			 filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p>
		
			<p><strong>My review:</strong> A single phrase defines this indescribable series: "The best product that 
			television has ever made". Yes, this series with only five seasons is able to mark our lives and to thrill
			 us like never before the television was able, I believe that this is the mark of the evolution of the TV, 
			 exposing that quality is not only in the cinema. This series is extremely meticulous and symbolist.</p>

			<p> <strong>Description:</strong> Friends (stylized as F•R•I•E•N•D•S) is an American television sitcom, 
				created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, which aired on NBC from September 22, 1994, to May 6, 2004, 
				lasting ten seasons. With an ensemble cast starring Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt 
				LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, the show revolves around six 20-30 something friends living in 
				Manhattan. The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions, in association with Warner Bros. 
				Television. The original executive producers were Kevin S. Bright, Marta Kauffman, and David Crane.<br>

				Friends received acclaim throughout its run, becoming one of the most popular television 
				shows of all time.[8] The series was nominated for 62 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning the Outstanding 
				Comedy Series award in 2002 for its eighth season. The show ranked no. 21 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest 
				TV Shows of All Time[9] and no. 7 on Empire magazine's The 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.
				In 1997, the episode "The One with the Prom Video" was ranked no. 100 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes 
				of All-Time.[12] In 2013, Friends ranked no. 24 on the Writers Guild of America's 101 Best Written TV 
				Series of All Time[13] and no. 28 on TV Guide's 60 Best TV Series of All Time.<br>
			</p>

			<p><strong>My review:</strong> Friends is Friends! No matter how much time passes, still, this is a 
			TV show very remembered and used as a reference. An incredible series, with wise jokes, stories that 
			trap you and at the end of each episode you end up feeling "friends" of them!
			I believe it is difficult some comedy series to beat them. This is the best TV show ever!
